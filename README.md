## Welcome to my Github ~Eric!

- I am studying for my Master's in Data Science at New York University (https://cds.nyu.edu/). I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Human Centered Design & Engineering from the University of Washington (https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) and specialized in UX research and project management. Working with qualitative data opened new perspectives for me on what it means to work with data and I want to translate those learnings onto quantitative data to bring forth valuable insights that would have otherwise been lost.
- Currently, I am a graduate research assistant for NYU's Center for Neural Science Kiani Lab (https://www.cns.nyu.edu/kianilab/Home.html) focusing on Neural Mechanisms Underlying Abstract Rule Learning and Generalization for AGI and also an AI intern at Austal USA Advaneced Technologies (https://usa.austal.com/austal-usa-advanced-technologies). Afterwards, I will be starting a new position at Shopify as an Applied Machine Learning Engineer (https://www.shopify.com/careers). My career goal is to get the opportunity to educate and interact with others interested in the field so that I can get exposure working with different people which will continue to nurture my growth and experience.
- In my free time, I spend my hours swimming & cooking to replenish lost calories from swimming (did someone metion beef wellington and tiramisu?).
- (Ignore my contribution numbers, I save generated images to be processed on github but that inflates my contribution number)
